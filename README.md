# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this challenge was learn the ETL process. Our goal was to clean the dataset for Amazing Prime to be able to update it on a daily basis. Throughout the module we learned how to extract, transform and upload the data based on where we were in the process. We also sometimes need to refactor our code in order to process the data more efficiently. By completing these steps we are able to take in new data every day and complete the fitting transformations and load said data in to the already existing tables in our database.
